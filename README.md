I think we need to update the mysql installation process for windows.  Mine broke until I reconfigured it to be a windows process.

This is still incomplete, lacking user authentication and very unpolished/no readme.  

However the many to many works as well as crud for at least one of them, I haven't done extensive testing yet.
